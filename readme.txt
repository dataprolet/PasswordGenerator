Hi! If you’ve stumbled upon this, please keep in mind that this program is NOT meant to replace your password manager. 
However, it CAN be used as a more secure method to manage your safely generated passwords.

While not cryptographically foolproof, the passwords generated by this program are relatively safe because they are long 
and do not include dictionary words that could be susceptible to dictionary attacks. An advantage over writing down your 
passwords in a book is that you can’t lose this generator. It can easily be accessed from anywhere in the world, as long 
as there is internet access.

A drawback is that anyone who knows your username, category, and password can replicate your passwords. However, this 
requires more variables than just your password for your password database. So, use with caution, but it certainly beats 
using weak passwords.

It can also NOT store passwords because it does not store but generate your passwords.
